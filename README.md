# Random-Java-Codes
This is a repository having random java codes. I am in grade 9 and still learning and still left with alot to learn. I have recently learnt looping in Java and will upload codes of them. An important note that I cofde on BlueJ and not VS Code, so some things in my code may not work if you copy paste it, please edit accordingly.
